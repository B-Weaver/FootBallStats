# FootBallStats
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I designed this program for tracking and editing the statistics of football players for my fantasy football league. Initially I had the stats saved in a .txt file and editing was a hassle with notepad. This program takes the .txt file and places the players and their stats in a struct named footBallPlayers.  Using this program enables a user to easily acces and edit the stats of any player they wish to keep track of.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the file has been read and all values are stored the user is prompted with a menu for instructions. With this menu the user is able to view all players' stats, view a particular player's stats, view players by position, add to a player's stats, edit a player's stats and position, or exit. The menu function is recursive which saved lines and time. Once the user makes a selection of what they wish to do, the selected function executes then calls the menu function again. This implementation of recurisve funtionality prevents the user from being limited to one choice in an efficient manner. Upon deciding to exit the user is prompted to save the changes to the .txt file or exit without saving.</p>
